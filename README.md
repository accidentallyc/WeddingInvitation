# WeddingInvitation
An html web page invitation for my wedding day on Dec 29, 2015.


*Impentation Details*
- There is nothing special about this other than sentemintal value. But it does use a library i never released called timeline.js? Maybe i should release it?. Timeline js creates a "timeline object", where you can hook into specific times and do actions.

Kind of like this
```
timeline.on(0.005, ()=> { ... });
timeline.on(0.012, ()=> { ... });
timeline.on(0.016, ()=> { ... });
timeline.play();
```
